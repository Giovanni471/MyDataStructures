# MyDataStructures
This is a small C# side project where I reimplement core data structures as plain classes. I’m still working on it, I’ll add more structures over time.

The code is intentionally simple with straightforward method names for insert, remove, search, and basic iteration. No external dependencies. it’s just a time-killer, nothing fancy.
