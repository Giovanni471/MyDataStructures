# MyDataStructures
This is a small C# side project where I reimplement core data structures as plain classes. I’m still working on it—right now it only includes a basic LinkedList implementation I wrote from scratch.

The code is intentionally simple with straightforward method names for insert, remove, search, and basic iteration. No external dependencies. it’s a time-killer to keep my fundamentals fresh.

I’ll add more structures over time, keeping the style consistent and the footprint small. Nothing fancy.
